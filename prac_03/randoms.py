# a Line 1:
# With the 1st run I saw 14. Line 1 prints a random integer number between the range of 5 to 20, including the boundaries.
# The smallest number that could be seen was 5 and the largest was 20.

# b Line 2:
# Line 2 prints a number between a range at a specific stepping increment. The general form is: random.randrange(start value, end value, step increment).
# The smallest number is 3 and the largest is 9.
# Line 2 could not have produced a 4. Only 3, 5, 7 or 9.

# c Line 3:
# Line 3 prints a random float number between 2.5 and 5.5.
# The smallest number possible is 2.5 and the largest is 5.5.
