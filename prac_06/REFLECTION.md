# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

Ensure I have covered all the lecture content before the Thursday afternoon session to get the most out of it. Doing as
much of
the practicals right after the session so I don't leave it until Sunday.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Preferably, I would like gradually do the lectures throughout the week, rather than in one day. This would definitely
make learning easier.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I will continue to start pracs early and attempt to finish them before Sunday. Also, continue to attend the Thursday
afternoon sessions.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Doing all the lectures on Thursday.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I don't have any suggestions with changing anything, but the demos in the lecture modules are really helpful when first
learning the new topics.
